# WorldOfTravel


WorldOfTravel is a travel booking website built with ASP.NET.

It uses Microsoft SQL Server database.

Backend languages: C#.

For front end: ASPX(Active Server Pages), HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

I've used some master pages too in this website which contains headers and footers of the website.

App contains Admin Login too.
